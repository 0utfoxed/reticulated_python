Review 1:
Create a string object that stores an integer as its value, then convert that string into an actual integer object using int() ; test that your new object is really a number by multiplying it by another number and displaying the result.

'''

number = "12"

real_number = int(number)

print(real_number*3)

'''

Review 2:
Create a string object and an integer object, then display them side-by-side with a single print statement by using the str() function

'''

string = "This is the number"

integer = 2

print(string, integer)
